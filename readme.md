*Let's hear it for the Sieve of Eratosthenes!*
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes
(You may think you need to check up to 1/2 the number you are checking is prime, but it is only the âˆšnumber (hmmm, is that why it is called a prime root?...))

# PRIME DANGER
- *Made as set of flashcards to memorize Prime numbers under 200 (Good to know for fast factoring on High School entrance exams in NYC).*
- *ToDo: Lots!*
  - step/streaked points plus bonus of the prime number
  - hard mode: primes up to 10M
  - crush rune tiles upon falling and add in physics library to help build the rubble (box2d or matter.js is the question)
  - encouraging character to give motivational dialog
  - more sparkles
  - music and sounds
  - timer, the rune stones should lower. As game progresses move faster just like Tetris...
